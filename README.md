## A Convolutional Neural Network for a Dog Breed Identification App 

In this project, I have built a pipeline that can be used within a web or mobile app to process real-world, user-supplied images. Given an image of a dog, the algorithm will identify an estimate of the canineâ€™s breed. If you supplied an image of a human, the code will identify the resembling dog breed. If you supplied an image that neither contains dog nor human, it will provide an output that indicates an error.
